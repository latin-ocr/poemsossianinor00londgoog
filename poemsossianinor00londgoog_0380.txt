Nonus ΤΟ FINGAL.

DUAN 1.

P. 4. r. t. Cosmum Cuthnllin the son of Semo, and grandson to
Caithbot, a druid celebrated in tradition lor his wisdorn and ndens.
Cuthullin when very young married Bragels the daughter of Sorglan,
and passing over into lselend, lived ior sorne time with Coonal, grend-
son by a daughter to Congal the petty iring os Ulster. llis wisdorn and
valour in a short time gained him such reputation, that in the minority
ol Cormac, the supreme ling oi lreland, ho was chusan guardian to the
young king, and sole manager oi the war against Swarun king oi Lochlin.
Astera series ol great sctions he wos killed in battle sornewhere in
Counaught, in the twenty-seventh year ol his age. He was so remark·
able t‘or his strength, that to describes strong man it hos passed into a
proverb, ‘⁶ He hus the strength ol Cuthullin.'’ They shew the ramains
oi his palsce st Dunscuich iu the lsle oi Slye; end a stone, to which he
bound his dog Lustb, goes still by his name.
P. 4. v. 5. Cairhar or Ceirbre, signifies ojierce strong mon.

previous intelligence oi the invasion intended by suscensent scouts all ,
over the coest of Ulliu, or Ulster, to give early notice of the first ap·
memnon ol the enemy, at the sometime that he sent lilunen the sun os
Stinual to implore the assistance ol Fingal. lle himself collected the
llower οἰ the lrish youth to Tura, s castle on the coast, to stop the
prognaes ol the enemy till Fingal should active from Scotlnnd. We msy
conclude stom Cuthullin's applying so early lor foreign eid, thet the
ln'sh were not theuso numerous as they have since been ; which is a
great presumption against the high antiqmties of thet people. We have
the testimony oi Tacitus, that one legion only was thought sufficient, in
the time ol Agricola, to reduce the whole island under the Roman yolre3
which would uot probably heve been the case had the islsnd been inlrs·

bited ior any number ol centuries before.
