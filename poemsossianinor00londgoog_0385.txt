certainly alludes to the religion of 1000110, and tle stone gfporocr here
mentioned is the image of one of the deities of scandinavia. ,

P. 108. v. at. 1101110100] All the north—west coast of Scotland pro·
bably went of old under thc name of Morven, which significa a ridge of
very high hills.

Nc aluidlt oir rcotlucl gu’ crll, dcc] This is the only
passage in the poem that has the appearance of religion. But Cuthullin's
apostrophe to this spirit is accompanied with a doubt, so that it is not
easy to determine whether the hero meant h superior being, or the ghosts
01 deceased warriors, who were supposed in those times to rule the
storms,and to transport themselves in a gust 01 wind from one country
to another.

P. 136. v. 463. 'N aia dt' etrict mcc Mloraigu moll, fac] Gaul, the
son of Morni, was chief of a tribe that disputed long the pre-eminence
with Fingal himself. They were reduced at last to obedience, arrd Gaul,
from an enemy, turned F ingal's best friend and greatest hero. llis cha·
racter is something like thet 01 Ajax in the lliad; a hero of more
strength than conduct in battle. l·le was very fond of military fame,
and here he demands the next battle to himself. 'lhe poet, by an arti·
fice, removes lingal, that his return may 00 the more magnificent.

P. 138. v. 497. Bi neminemnam 'a mi ω’ cluam] The poet pm·
pares us for the dream of Pingsl in the next book.

DUA'N IV.

Ρ, 144, Fracta being asleep, and the action suspended by night, the
poet introduces the story of his courtship of Everallin the daughter of
Branno. The episode is necessary to clear up several passages that fol·
low in the poem 3 at the same time that it naturally brings on the action
of the boolt, which may 00 supposed to begin about the middle of the
third night from the opening of the poem. This 0001, as many of
Ossian’s other compositione, is addressed to the beautiful Malrina, the

daughter of Toscar. She appears to have been in love with Oscor, and
to have affected the company of the father after the death of the son.
